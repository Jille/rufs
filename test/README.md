rufs testsuite
==============

To run all tests, run `./test.sh`. If you want to re-run a single test after this, go to the test directory and run `./run-test.sh`.

These tests use Vagrant.

The tests use shared directories. If your system uses VirtualBox, you may need to `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`.
