1. TCP tunneling

service BouncerService {
	rpc BounceMe(BounceRequest) returns (stream BounceResponse) {
	}
}

message BounceResponse {
	int32 bounce_port = 1;
	int32 receive_port = 2;
	int32 open_connections = 3;
}

Peer without a public IP gRPCs to the bouncer, calls BounceMe.

Peer connects at least $open_connections to $receive_port. Later messages will change $open_connections, but not $bounce_port or $receive_port.

Advantages:
* Fully transparent to others
* One TCP stream per connection
* No double encryption or re-encryption
* Bouncer can't MITM

Downsides:
* Bouncers need to open multiple ports

2. gRPC stream multiplexing

service BouncerService {
  rpc BounceMe(stream BounceRequest) returns (stream BounceResponse) {
	}

	rpc TalkToBouncee(stream TalkToBounceeRequest) returns (stream TalkToBounceeResponse) {
	}
}

message BounceRequest {
	int64 connection_id = 1;
	bytes data = 2;
	bool close = 3;
}

message BounceResponse {
	int64 connection_id = 1;
	bytes data = 2;
	bool close = 3;

	// your_id needs to be given to TalkToBounceeRequest.peer_id. It's only returned in the first response.
	int64 your_id = 4;
}

message TalkToBounceeRequest {
	int64 peer_id = 1;
	bytes data = 1;
}

message TalkToBounceeResponse {
	bytes data = 1;
}

Advantages:
* Single port
* Bouncer can't MITM

Disadvantages:
* Clients need to understand how to talk through bouncers
* Multiple streams over a single TCP connection (gets less priority from routers)
* Double encryption
* Bouncer needs to decrypt and encrypt all data


## Without SSL?

Maybe the bouncer could run without SSL because all traffic it's moving is already encrypted?

3. Combined

Communication with the bouncee happens like #2's BounceMe, but the bouncer opens up a new port and forwards traffic over the BounceMe stream.

Advantages:
* Fully transparent to others
* Bouncer doesn't need to decrypt all data

Disadvantages:
* Multiple streams over a single TCP connection (gets less priority from routers)
* Double encryption
* Bouncer needs to encrypt all data
* Bouncers need to open multiple ports
